## 🌍 Problem Statement
Every day, tons of surplus food from restaurants, events, and households goes to waste while millions of people face hunger and food insecurity.  
Current donation platforms are fragmented, lack **real-time AI-powered matching**, and do not enforce **clear separation of cooked vs. raw food**—a critical requirement for food safety and compliance.

## 💡 Our Solution – Meal Bridge
**Meal Bridge** is an AI-powered redistribution platform that connects food donors with NGOs and communities in need.  
We leverage **Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and Google Maps APIs** to ensure food reaches the right place at the right time.

**Core Features:**
- ✅ Donor portal with **separate sections for cooked & raw food**.  
- ✅ **AI-driven matching** between donors and NGOs based on demand, location, and food type.  
- ✅ **Route optimization** with Google Maps to minimize delivery time and carbon footprint.  
- ✅ **Real-time tracking** and transparency for donors & recipients.  
- ✅ Compliance with food safety guidelines (USDA / FDA).
