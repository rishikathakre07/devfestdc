## ‚ú® Vision
**Meal Bridge ‚Äì From Waste to Wonder.**  
Together, let‚Äôs bridge the gap between surplus and scarcity.

---

## üåç Problem Statement
Every day, tons of surplus food from restaurants, fast food joints, cafeterias, and bakeries goes to waste, while millions of people at shelters, food banks, and homeless communities face hunger and food insecurity.  
Current donation systems are fragmented, lack **real-time matching**, and often don‚Äôt enforce **clear separation of cooked vs. raw food**, which is critical for safety and compliance.

---

## üí° Our Solution
**Meal Bridge** is an **AI-powered redistribution platform** that connects food donors (restaurants, fast food outlets, cafeterias, events) with NGOs and shelters serving vulnerable communities. It also assigns volunteers automatically for pickup and delivery.

### Core Features
- ‚úÖ Donor portal with **separate handling for cooked & raw food**.  
- ‚úÖ **AI-driven matching** between donors and NGOs based on demand, food type, and location.  
- ‚úÖ Volunteers chosen by **proximity to donor** for faster logistics.  
- ‚úÖ **Google Maps integration** for optimized routing (volunteer ‚Üí restaurant ‚Üí NGO).  
- ‚úÖ **Real-time JSON logs + web UI** for transparency and accountability.
